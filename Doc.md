### Problems that I have faces

1. I have started developing the app by the card component by the time creating the card I don't have any idea about the passing data so I went with the static data. So the first thing I have to find was the card scrolling horizontally.
2. After the card I went for the standard row display there was some minor syntax error that I have to face during the implementation of the checkbox.
3. The continue button at the bottom of the app has taken some time to implement but I have figured it out by viewing through some articles.
4. The main fear I had was the passing state to the child component from the parent component within the updated(selected) subjects with their's standard.
5. I also have to found out about the filter part for the display checked of the checkbox.
6. The scrolling with Listing of all data was also being problematic for a couple of times so I have to use "Expanded" in the parent of it.
7. I tried to load data through the JSON file, But I couldn't do it. So I just called the data in the file.
8. On the top Right photo, I tried to make it as similar as the design, but I couldn't find the container overlap thing.
9. The appbar with disappearing was hard to implement in it so I put it in the container(layout). I know it's not an idle way of writing code, but I find it simple so I implement it
